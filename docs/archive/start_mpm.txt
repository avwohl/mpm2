- create private github repository mpm2
- add this current tree ~/src/mpm2 and fugure work

We wrote an ada compiler (uada80) for the z80. For a lot of its multi tasking tests
it needs a multi tasking OS.

One of the few multi tasking OSes for the z80 is MP/M II. 
In mpm2_external/mpm2dist is the mpm2 distribution.
In mpm2_external/mpm2src is the full source code for for mpm2 for refrence.

Your job is to bring up an mpm II system for the ada compiler to test
its multi user aspects.
 - to start convert mpm2_external/docs/*.pdf to text. otherwise
 you tend to lock up trying to read large pdfs
 - minimum of 4 terminals (so multi part programs can be run at the same time)
 - mpm2dist assumes you are starting with a working cp/m 2.2 system
 - ~/src/cpmemu/src/cpmemu is cp/m 2 emulator at the bdos level
 it translate cp/m bdos calls to linux.  So you can ask for FOO.TXT
 to open in cpm and it will find foo.txt in linux.  Add to CLAUDE.md
 info about the .cfg files it use as they control the crlf end of line
 per file type. and mappign long linux file names into the 8.3 cpm file space
 * in cpmemu are qkz* files. They are a z80/8080 emulator in c++ that can
 be embeded. you will probably need to use this directly to get all the multi
 user syncronization right.  It was not written with threading in mind
 and may need some updates for it
 - ~/src/romwmw_emu is a cli z80 emulator that boots the romwbw eco system.
 That supports multiple OSes.  But I don't see MP/M II as an option.  It may or may not
 be of use in building a mpm 2 system
 - ~/src/um80_and_friends is a python based assembler, linker, library manager
 it can be used to assemble the needed bios and boot files for mp/m 2
 - it is not clear to me how the needed 4 termianals for mp/m 2 should work.
 Maybe mp/m 2 should be one multi threaded process.  You can ssh into it get a different thread
 and a mp/m 2 terminal
 - I generally prefer to write in python. However the above qkz80* library is in c++
 And I think if we the ssh in to a terminal thing thats going work a lot better with c++
 - to start build a one terminal mp/m 2 system.  I think if you target the romwbw_emu
 hbios system it should be straight forward.  Note that the romwbw_emu emulator supports
 maskable and nmi periodic interrupts that can be used for mp/m 2 scheduling
 - mpm2_external/docs/MPM2SYS.TXT is the guide on how bring up new mp/m system
 starting with cp/m 2.2 which is roughly what we have
