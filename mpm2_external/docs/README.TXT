This archive contains:

 MPM2SYS.DOC  - the formatted text, a WinWord document
 MPM2SYS.TXT  - the raw text file from Tim Olmstead
 README.TXT   - what you are reading now


I have included the raw text, because it contains the
Appendix E, a sample banked XIOS, which was useless for
my unbanked system. Maybe, when I will find the time, I
will append it to the Word document, formatted.

Or, if somebody else wants to do it: let me know.
